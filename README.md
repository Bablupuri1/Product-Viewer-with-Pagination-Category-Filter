# Product-Viewer-with-Pagination-Category-Filter
This is a full-stack mini web application built using Spring Boot (backend) and React (frontend) that allows users to browse products with pagination and filter them based on categories. It simulates a basic e-commerce catalog system, ideal for understanding REST APIs, frontend-backend integration, and state management in React.
